# AppDbContext Clean Architecture Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the `AppDbContext` class in the Infrastructure layer of the PeopleSearch solution, focusing on its dependencies and adherence to clean architecture principles.

---

## AppDbContext Dependencies

- **Domain Entity Reference:**  
  `AppDbContext` references the `Person` class from the Domain layer: public DbSet<Person> People { get; set; }
  
This is correct and expected in clean architecture. Domain entities are not considered infrastructure or application-level concrete implementations.

- **EF Core Abstraction:**  
Inherits from `DbContext`, which is an abstraction provided by Entity Framework Core.

- **No Direct Repository or Service References:** 
`AppDbContext` does not reference or depend on any repository, service, or UI class.  
It only exposes `DbSet<T>` properties for domain entities and configures them in `OnModelCreating`.

- **OnModelCreating:** 
Seeds initial data for the `Person` entity using EF Core's standard features. This does not introduce any architectural issues.

---

## What Would Be a Problem

- If `AppDbContext` referenced a concrete repository, service, or UI class, it would violate clean architecture principles.
- If it instantiated or depended on infrastructure-specific logic outside of EF Core configuration, that would be a problem.

---

## Signature Review

- The signatures show only domain entities and EF Core abstractions are used.
- No evidence of improper concrete dependencies.

---

## Summary

- **AppDbContext only references domain entities and EF Core abstractions.**
- **It does not use or depend on any concrete application or infrastructure implementations.**
- **No architectural violations detected.**

AppDbContext is clean and adheres to best practices for separation of concerns in .NET 8 and clean architecture.
