# Solution Architecture Overview

## Clean Architecture Analysis

This solution follows Clean Architecture principles, ensuring separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. Below is an overview of the project structure, dependencies, and key practices.

---

## Project Structure

### 1. **Domain Layer**
- **Purpose:** Contains core business entities and interfaces.
- **Contents:**  
  - Entities: `Person`, `Address`, `State`
  - Repository interfaces: `IPeopleRepository`, `IAddressRepository`, `IStateRepository`
- **Dependencies:**  
  - No dependencies on other layers.
- **Best Practice:**  
  - No DTOs, mapping, or infrastructure references.

### 2. **Infrastructure Layer**
- **Purpose:** Implements data access and external integrations.
- **Contents:**  
  - EF Core `AppDbContext`
  - Repository implementations: `PeopleRepository`, `AddressRepository`, `StateRepository`
- **Dependencies:**  
  - References Domain entities and interfaces.
- **Best Practice:**  
  - No references to DTOs or application services.

### 3. **Application Layer**
- **Purpose:** Contains business logic, service interfaces, DTOs, and mapping.
- **Contents:**  
  - Service interfaces: `IPeopleService`, `IAddressService`, `IStateService`
  - Service implementations: `PeopleService`, `AddressService`, `StateService`
  - DTOs: `PersonDto`, `AddressDto`, `StateDto`
  - Mapping classes: `PersonMapping`, `AddressMapping`, `StateMapping`
- **Dependencies:**  
  - References Domain entities and interfaces.
- **Best Practice:**  
  - Maps between domain entities and DTOs.
  - No references to infrastructure implementations.

### 4. **UI Layer (PeopleSearch)**
- **Purpose:** User interface (WinForms).
- **Contents:**  
  - Forms: `Form1.cs`
  - Program entry: `Program.cs`
- **Dependencies:**  
  - References Application interfaces and DTOs.
- **Best Practice:**  
  - No direct references to domain entities or infrastructure.
  - All data binding and service calls use DTOs.

## Key Clean Architecture Practices

- **Dependency Rule:**  
  - Inner layers (Domain, Application) do not depend on outer layers (Infrastructure, UI).
- **DTO Usage:**  
  - UI and Application layers use DTOs for data transfer.
  - Repositories and Domain use only domain entities.
- **Mapping:**  
  - Mapping between entities and DTOs is handled in the Application layer.
- **Service Registration:**  
  - Dependency Injection is used in `Program.cs` to register interfaces and implementations.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Robust error handling in data import and service layers.

---

## Example Dependency Flow

UI (PeopleSearch) | v Application (Services, DTOs, Mapping) | v Domain (Entities, Interfaces) ^ | Infrastructure (Repositories, DbContext)

---

## How to Extend or Maintain

- **Add new features:**  
  - Define new entities and interfaces in Domain.
  - Implement repositories in Infrastructure.
  - Add DTOs, mapping, and services in Application.
  - Update UI to use new DTOs and service interfaces.
- **Testing:**  
  - Test business logic in Application layer.
  - Mock repositories for unit tests.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do **not** reference domain entities in the UI layer.
- Do **not** use DTOs in repositories or domain entities.
- Do **not** reference infrastructure in the Application or Domain layers.

---

## Summary

This solution is structured for clean architecture.  
- **UI** interacts with **Application** via DTOs and interfaces.
- **Application** maps DTOs to domain entities and calls repositories.
- **Infrastructure** implements repositories and data access.
- **Domain** contains only core business logic and contracts.

**Follow this structure for maintainable, scalable, and testable software.**
